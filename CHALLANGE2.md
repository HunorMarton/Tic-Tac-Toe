## What I believe is cool
* The animation for the Cross and the Circle and the part when the computer pretends to think a bit before it responds.

## Design changes
* As the mock-up is rather a sketch I felt free to change add color and change the look of the circle and cross.
* The game over text has no reason to be triple size of the board itself.

## What should be improved
* The most unprofessional part of the application is the data structure of the board. Initially I planned to implement the app as a multiplayer game where the computer does not take turns, and for that it is more or less okay. But with AI it is already getting messy and it's not scaleable at all.
* The AI is really basic. I didn't wanted to spend too much time to implement a proper logic and it would have required to rewrite the data structure.
* There might be bugs. For example theoretically nothing stops you from taking two turns before the computer responds. You would have to be super fast, but still.
* Mobile optimization is completely missing.

## Different approaches
* So far this boilerplate worked for me. If I do more than that what can fit into a codepen.io Pen then I use this.
* Some Tic-tac-toe logic library might could have been handy, but I didn't look up as that would have requited some time to understand them (if there is any).

## Things I could not figure out
* How to add a custom font. At some point it worked, but honestly I don't know how webpack handles fonts.
* Knowing that this challenge is expected to take around 4 hours was a bit frustrating, because I spent a bit more time and I still could spend a lot, but I think it is okay now.

## Overall thoughts
* I think the code and the structure is good. Not perfect, like the utility folder is rather the game logic folder but it is good enough.
* There is not so much CSS so I guess you can't really figure out much style from it.
* I think it looks nice.
* It is really basic, the AI should be improved.
